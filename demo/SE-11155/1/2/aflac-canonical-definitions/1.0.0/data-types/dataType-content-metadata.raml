  location:
    displayName: Location
    description: |
      Detailed information about the location of the content.  A content can be a record in a database, a file in a file system, in a referencable site, or some other type of an entry that have not been defined at this point in time.  
      The ultimate goal of the location property is to "locate" where the content has been persisted.  
      The consumer originally would not know this information but would get this information from the provider as part of the metadata.
      An array of name value pairs can generically define any location.
      location-type: (database | file-system | reference)
      database: name of the database
      schema: name of the schema, owner, plan etc.
      table: name of the table, view, etc.
      os: name of the operating system
      file-path: complete path in that operating system
      file-name: the name of the file where the content has been persisted
      reference-type: what type of reference is the content located at
      reference-uri: the uri that shows the exact location of the content
    required: false
    type: property-lib.properties
    example:
      value:
        - name: location-type
          value: database

  categories:
    displayName: Categories
    description: Content may belong to different categories.  These categories may be used to persist the content in different locations so that their search can be executed more effectively.  For example, contents that contain claim information may be persisted in a claim repository with other claim content, while content that contains application information may be persisted in a different repository.  These line of business categorization may be used to organize content in more manageable ways.  There may be other types of categorizations such as the freshness of the content.  Some active content may be persisted in a location that can read and written very quickly.  Some much older content that has been used but cannot be deleted can be archived.  Even though the location is much harder to reach and much slower to read, the content is still available, yet in a different location.  Since there is no way of knowing how many of these categorization keys are available, this property is an array of name value pairs
